Figure 3.10. Example of further not divided edge segment, which generates data entries,
where certain values overlap. For example the score is shared among all images produced
from one segment.

The former works in extracting high dimensional features of incoming imagery data, - high dimensional features ??

Custom top model
Both of these attributes influence the amount of parameters of our model. We can try various combinations of these parameters to explore the models optimal shape.

4.6.1 Data Split
Traditionally we split our dataset into two sets â€“ training set, which we use for training of
model and so called validation set, which is used only for models performance evaluation.

Each of these will run a
full training ended by an evaluation giving us score. Eventually we can calculate the
average score with standard deviation.
